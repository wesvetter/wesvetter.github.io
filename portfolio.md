## Teleomed Labs - "Business Stuff"

![Company Business Cards](https://wesvetter-www.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/biz-cards.png)

Business cards I designed for our company. The back is blank for notes, in case
you need to jot any other details down.

![Hiring Trial Contract](https://wesvetter-www.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/biz-contractor-doc.png)

Excerpt from our hiring trial contract. Rather than use ineffective whiteboard
interviews, we ask candidates to do small trial projects (for actual stuff we
need) **and pay them!**. I also personally responded to every application, even
if it was a rejection, because we know how much it sucks to have an application
go into the void, never to be seen again.

![Customer Apology Email](https://wesvetter-www.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/biz-incident-mgmt.png)

When we had an incident on a staging server that accidentally sent a few users
dozens of emails, I wrote the apology email and responded to customer
questions.

![SoW for U.S. Navy work](https://wesvetter-www.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/biz-navy-sow.png)

I've written or edited multiple $100K+ contracts/statement-of-work documents.

![Teleomed homepage](https://wesvetter-www.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/biz-www-home.png)

I redesigned the existing company website to modern styles to be mobile-friendly.

![0by25 - CMS page](https://wesvetter-www.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/0by25-cms-page.png)

A site built for the International Society of Nephrology using Django (python)
and BackboneJS. The project involved a global study of kidney disease and
required a public-facing site, as well as a portal for providers to download
forms, enter data, and get updates on the project.

The study dashboard. Hundreds of providers from 70+ countries participated in
the study.

## UCSD - Undergraduate Research Portal

![UCSD - Undergraduate Research Portal](https://wesvetter-www.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ucsd-urp.png)

A student job portal for part-time work and internships, I helped develop the
URP alongside another contractor. I built the LinkedIn integration and Single
Sign-On authentication in order for students to be able to import profile data
from LinkedIn. The site was built using Ruby-on-Rails and used Solr for search.
